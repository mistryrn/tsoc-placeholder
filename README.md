Feel free to use this code as you may. By changing a few images and a couple lines of code, this project allows you to create a clean, simple placeholder site with social media links for your business/organization/etc in minutes.

# Note: this placeholder is no longer in use at http://thesoundofchange.org/
* This project is a child of my "Personal Website Placeholder Template" project (https://github.com/mistryrn/personalsite)
