The Sound of Change Placeholder
================

Source code and resources for The Sound of Change's placeholder site - http://www.thesoundofchange.org/

Feel free to use this code as you may. By changing a few images and a couple lines of code, this project allows you to create a clean, simple placeholder site with social media links for your business/organization/etc in minutes.
